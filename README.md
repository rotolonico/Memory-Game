# Memory-Game
Tiny but challenging memory game

## How to download?
Clone or download this repository, open the folder "Memory Test Game" and open the right executable for your Operative System

## How to play?
Once you click the "Start" button you will have a customizable number of seconds to try and memorize the colors (also customizable) on a 4x4 grid. Once the grid turns white you will be able to click on any of the color squares to select that color and then click on a grid tile to color it! Your objective is to color the grid so it is the closest possible to the original! Once you are done you will be brought back to the editor and you'll get a score! You can also customize the number of colors and the number of seconds by clicking on the "Colors" or "Time" buttons

### Why did I create this game?
I have challenged myself to create a game in 4/5 hours. I am pretty new to game making with Unity so this is just a test to see what I can achieve with that editor in that time! That said, have fun :D
